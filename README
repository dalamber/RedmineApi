The "redmine_api" module allows you to:

- Authorize in Redmine system using API key or plain user/password data.
- Add new versions.
- Open/Lock/Close existing versions.
- Obtain list of all issues assigned to given version number.

The module should not be considered as a full-fledged Redmine API for Python. 
Initially, it was developed to get the changes list for the C++ project that is being built under Jenkins CI.

P.S. thx 'svv' for his ideas and code pieces.
